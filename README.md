# Millingo

This was my final project for a web design course I took. I had to combine skills I learned in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery in order to create a website of my choosing from scratch.

The word "Millingo" is a combination of two words: Millenial Lingo.

The purpose of the website it to teach older generations the meaning of certain words and terminologies technology has created.

It can be accessed at sfarhat.github.io/millingo. Enjoy!
